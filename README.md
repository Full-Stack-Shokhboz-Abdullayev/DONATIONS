## What challender I faced?

#### Frontend

1. In the first glance, it seemed like easy to convert amount with external api. However there was the case where the task documentation pointed to prepared data.

2. When beautifying/formatting converted amount, it was the     tricky moment for me.

3. Changing suggestions/presets into another conversions made me think a bit. Luckiliy you see it is ready to rock.

#### Backend 

No hardships (sorry for that.)
